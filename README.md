# Confreaks.tv Top Videos

DEMO: https://confreaks.firebaseapp.com/

This is a React app to display the top talks on [Confreaks.TV](http://confreaks.tv/), a conference talk video aggregation site.

I started building this app before I relaized that [Confreaks.TV](http://confreaks.tv/) already shows the top watched videos on their home page.

Oh well - I had fun learning react, and now you can browse to the Nth most popular video on this, which you can't do on their site. That's kinda neat.`

## Tech stack

This app uses React, Firebase, Bootstrap, and firebase-util for paging the firebase data.

## To Run

`npm install` then `gulp` should do the trick.
