# Confreaks.tv Top Videos

I started building this app before I relaized that the conference aggregation site [Confreaks.TV](http://confreaks.tv/) showed already shows the top watched videos on their home page.

Oh well - I had fun learning react, and now you can browse to the Nth most popular video, which is neat.

## To Run

`npm install` then `gulp` should do the trick.
